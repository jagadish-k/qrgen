# Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are required for the Chrome extension to work properly.

You can create simple QR code themed icons or use placeholder icons for development.

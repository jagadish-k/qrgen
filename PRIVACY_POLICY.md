# Privacy Policy for QR Gen Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: July 21, 2025**

## Overview

QR Gen is a Chrome extension that generates QR codes locally in your browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how our extension operates.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Don't Collect

- **Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- **QR Code Content**: All QR codes are generated locally in your browser - we never see or store the content you encode
- **Browsing Data**: We do not track your browsing history or website visits
- **Analytics**: We do not use analytics services or tracking pixels
- **User Accounts**: We do not require registration or maintain user accounts

### What We Access (When You Choose To)

- **Images for Color Extraction**: When you upload an image or provide an image URL for color extraction, the image is processed locally in your browser. No image data is sent to external servers
- **Google Maps URLs**: When you paste a Google Maps URL for location parsing, the URL is processed locally to extract coordinates. No URL data is transmitted externally

## Local Processing

All functionality of QR Gen operates entirely within your browser:

- QR code generation happens client-side using JavaScript libraries
- Image color extraction is performed locally using Canvas API
- Google Maps URL parsing uses client-side JavaScript
- All generated QR codes remain on your device until you download them

## Permissions

### Required Permissions

None. QR Gen operates without requiring any special permissions from Chrome.

### Optional Permissions

None. All features work without requesting any permissions.

## External Connections

QR Gen may connect to external services only for:

- **Google Maps Shortened URLs**: To resolve goo.gl and maps.app.goo.gl shortened URLs when parsing location data

These connections are made only when you actively use these specific features and do not transmit personal information.

## Data Security

- All data processing occurs locally on your device
- No sensitive information is transmitted over the internet
- Generated QR codes are stored temporarily in browser memory and cleared when the extension is closed
- Uploaded images for color extraction are processed in memory and not stored

## Third-Party Services

QR Gen does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The extension operates independently without sharing data with external parties.

## Children's Privacy

QR Gen does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The extension is designed to be safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
